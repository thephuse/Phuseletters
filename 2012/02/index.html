		<strong>Dear Phusers,</strong>
		<p>As a treat for everyone who keeps in touch with us via this monthly 
		newsletter, an exclusive sneak peak of The Phuse’s new redesign!</p>
		
		
		
		<p>Known internally as RePhuse, the first shot is of the homepage. 
		A crisper, cleaner design, one we think better shows our goals and 
		preferences as an agency.</p>
		
		
		
		<p>The second image is a bit of a surprise. Meet Circuits, the newly 
		rebranded Phuse Blog. We hope Circuits makes for a better reading 
		experience where both content and usability are concerned. 
		We’ve got a bunch of new articles in the works on design, 
		copywriting, and more, so keep an eye out!</p>
		
		<strong>Freshly Pressed</strong>
		<p>Speaking of the blog, here’s some stuff we wrote in February. 
		These articles are written for developers, mostly, but even if you’re 
		not a hardcore coder you might be able to pick up some tips on 
		how that part of our business works:</p>
		
		
		<div>
		<p>
			<a href="#">Getting Into the Flow with Git</a> — James explains how we use Git and Terminal to collaborate on code within our team, and with other teams like our friends at Highgroove.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			<a href="#">9 Benefits of Clean Coding Habits</a> — Coding habits are as 
			good for your own headaches as they are for your user’s experience. Jenna explains.
		</p>
		</div>

		<p>Hope you’re all keeping warm this winter, <br>
		may the Spring come at exactly the right time.</p>
		
		<p>The Phuse Team,
		James, Erik, Matt, Jenna, Mitch, and Rigel</p>
		
		
		<strong>The Phuse would love to hear from you</strong>
		<p>Send us emails. Heaps of them. Whether it’s an idea for a project, 
		a curiosity that won’t stop itching at your brain, or if you, too, wonder how James seems to be in three places at once*, we hope you don’t hesitate to get in touch!</p>
		
		<p><em>* It’s not a teleporter—but it might be magic. The matter is still under investigation.</em></p>
